# C Practice Repository

This repository contains my hands-on C programming exercises, sorted by concept.

## Source

These exercises follow along with  
[Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms using C and C++](https://www.udemy.com/course/datastructurescncpp/), one of the most popular resources for learning data structures from scratch.

### Each script inside the functions/ directory focuses on teaching me a specific concept: whether it’s memory management, pointer manipulation, or struct behavior.

## Automation ⚙️

A GitHub Actions workflow runs on weekdays to:
	1.	Generate a new pointer-focused exercise file in exercises/.
	2.	Commit it to the repository.
	3.	Open a GitHub Issue linking to the new drill for easy tracking.
