# C Practice Repository

This repository contains my hands-on C programming exercises, sorted by concept.

## Source

These exercises follow along with  
[Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms using C and C++ by Abdul Bari](https://www.udemy.com/course/datastructurescncpp/), one of the most popular resources for learning data structures from scratch.

## Structure

- `functions/`: Basics of parameter passing, return types, etc.
- `structs/`: Declaring, using, and dynamically allocating structs.
- `arrays/`: Working with arrays, pointer decay, and memory.
